This example demonstrates a common error when working with generics in Scala: comparing values of different types within a generic method. The code defines a class `MyClass` with a generic type `T`. The `myMethod` attempts to compare two instances of `MyClass` using `==`. This fails at compile time because the compiler doesn't know how to compare arbitrary types `T`.  The solution shows how to address this using type constraints or more sophisticated comparison logic.
